# Rents in San Francsisco 2000-2018

[Kate Pennington](https://www.katepennington.org/data) created a panel of historic Craigslist rents by scraping posts archived by the Wayback Machine. You can read more about her work here

[What impact does new housing have on rents, displacement, and gentrification in the surrounding neighborhood? Read our interview with economist Kate Pennington about her article, "Does Building New Housing Cause Displacement?:The Supply and Demand Effects of Construction in San Francisco."](https://matrix.berkeley.edu/research-article/kate-pennington-on-gentrification-and-displacement-in-san-francisco/)

In our case, we have a clean(ish) dataset with about 200K rows that correspond to Craigslist listings for renting properties in the greater SF area. The data dictionary is as follows

| variable    | class     | description           |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| post_id     | character | Unique ID             |
| date        | double    | date                  |
| year        | double    | year                  |
| nhood       | character | neighborhood          |
| city        | character | city                  |
| county      | character | county                |
| price       | double    | price in USD          |
| beds        | double    | n of beds             |
| baths       | double    | n of baths            |
| sqft        | double    | square feet of rental |
| room_in_apt | double    | room in apartment     |
| address     | character | address               |
| lat         | double    | latitude              |
| lon         | double    | longitude             |
| title       | character | title of listing      |
| descr       | character | description           |
| details     | character | additional details    |

The dataset was used in a recent [tidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.

```{r}
# download directly off tidytuesdaygithub repo

rent <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-05/rent.csv')

```

What are the variable types? Do they all correspond to what they really are? Which variables have most missing values?

```{r skim_data}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
skimr::skim(rent)

```

Make a plot that shows the top 20 cities in terms of % of classifieds between 2000-2018. You need to calculate the number of listings by city, and then convert that number to a %.

The final graph should look like this![](images/top_cities.png)

```{r top_cities}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
rent %>% 
  count(city, sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = prop, n=20) %>% 
  mutate(city = fct_reorder(city, prop)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= prop, y=city))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(
    title = ,
    subtitle = ,
    
  )

```

Make a plot that shows the evolution of median prices in San Francisco for 0, 1, 2, and 3 bedrooms listings. The final graph should look like this

```


![](images/sf_rentals.png)

```{r sf_median_prices}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
rent %>% 
    
  filter(beds<4) %>% 
  group_by(beds, year) %>% 
  
  summarize(mp=median( price )) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year , y=mp,colour=factor(beds))) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~beds)+
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

```

Finally, make a plot that shows median rental prices for the top 2 cities in the Bay area. Your final graph should look like this

![](images/one_bed_bay_area.png)

```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

rent %>% 
  
  filter(beds==1,  city==c("berkeley","mountain view","oakland", "palo alto", "san francisco","san jose", "san mateo", "santa clara","santa cruz", "santa rosa", "sunnyvale", "union city")) %>% 
  group_by( city,year) %>% 
  summarize(mp=median( price )) %>% 
  #slice_max(order_by = mp, n=12) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year , y=mp,)) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~city)
  
  

```
